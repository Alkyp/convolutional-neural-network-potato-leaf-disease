# 🥔 Potato Leaf Disease Detection using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automatically detect **diseases in potato leaves** based on leaf images. The deep learning model classifies leaf conditions into **healthy** and **diseased** categories with high accuracy.

The system is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and provides an **interactive web application powered by Streamlit**, making it accessible and easy to use.
